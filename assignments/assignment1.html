            This website is a place for me to share what I cooked with the world

            Sometimes, I include detailed recipes for them, which everyone I have ever
            shared them with have loved them and make them every single day without fail.

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I served some to Professor Burns over Zoom and he said he'll never have to go
            to the doctor ever again with how many apples I put in it. Nobody likes going to
            the doctor because it's expensive, so it's a win-win because this cake is also
            delicious. Anyway, I almost burned everything down by just preheating my oven,
            so just be sure to have a fire extinguisher on hand in that step. Maybe the contents
            of that extinguisher add a little extra flavor. Special thanks to Monika Grabkowska
            for taking this beautiful picture.

        <h2>Every College Student's Cheapest but Most Delicious Meal: Ramen</h2>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            Special thanks to Behnam Norouzi for taking this wonderful photo of my breakfast
            today. You can click on the image for a link to his profile on Unsplash. Honestly
            he should've asked me before making it free to use for everyone, but it's okay.
            There's no recipe for this one since it's really just explained on the package.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this tastes good. Good as in not draining my wallet and also in flavor.
            I wish that I had more toppings to put on, like scallions and maybe some hot sauce.
            But I can't afford anything much but the water used to cook the noodles and the
            shredded/ground-up seaweed.

        <h3>Rating some ramen brands</h3>
        <p>
            I wanted to rate some ramen brands since there's no recipe here today.
            If you disagree, there's no comment button for you to tell me, not sorry!

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Heel Ramyun</td>
                <td>
                    The best brand of ramen noodles there is in terms of flavor.
                    However, the only thing that takes it away from first place is the price.
                    It's not bad but not too affordable at the price of $50 per package.
                    Still, it's a popular brand for a reason.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Marusan Ramen</td>
                <td>
                    The cheapest of the bunch but also a miss flavor wise. Though it brags several
                    flavors, honestly, a bunch of them are pretty bad. I would not recommend buying
                    these unless your wallet is in desperate need of help and you need a meal.
                    It does make for good aesthetic pictures if you stack a bunch of the cups up though.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Bulwak Ramen</td>
                <td>
                    Every flavor, they never miss. Although the flavor is a little below Heel's,
                    this is the best ramen for your buck. Honestly might be a little better than Heel's with
                    the flavors they've been producing recently, and a lot of people I know eat this
                    after a long day's work.
                </td>
            </tr>

            I know this was really cheesy and not that funny, but at the very least,
            I hope it wasn't boring!
