        <p>
            This is a simple page about all things astronomy related, like the
            stars and planets, just anything space related. We may change this
            more frequently in the future; the contents of this page will change
            at any time.

        <h3>Jupiter</h3>

        <p>
            Below are some fun facts I've gathered about Jupiter from other sites.
            These sources include Universe Today and Nine Planets.
        </p>

        <!-- grid -->
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
                Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the solar system, spinning
                at 45,300km/h, or 28,148 mph.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                Jupiter has 79 moons. Most of them are not very big (10km), but still,
                there are a lot. The most prominent ones are known as the Galilean Moons.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system and is bigger than all
                the other planets combined (almost by 2x).
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                Jupiter is like a magnet for comets and asteroids, attracting them with its
                gravity, which in a way protects other planets in the solar system from being
                hit by them.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                Jupiter is a gas giant, being made up of hydrogen and helium for the most part.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                One year on Jupiter is 11.8 Earth years because of how far away it is from the
                Sun, and the days only last 10 hours.

        <h3>Saturn</h3>

        <p>Below is a picture of Saturn.</p>

        <!-- id selector -->
        <p id="yellow-para">
            Because Saturn's color is a hazy yellow-brown, this text is light yellow.
            As you can see, Saturn has many rings around it.

        <h3>Neptune</h3>

        <!-- multiple class selector here -->
        <p class="red-para" id="make-red-visible">
            WARNING: Visiting this planet will take 12 years, and not to mention, it's really
            cold there. It is STRONGLY advised for you not to go there.
        </p>
        <p>
            A long time ago, according to NASA, Neptune took its shape at the same time as
            the formation of the solar system. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together
            to make it. It makes me wonder if other planets were created a similar way.
