    <title>Sarah's Music Recommendations!</title>
    <!-- 
        This site is supposed to be a music recommendation site where a user can complete a form and
        a list of music recommendations will be given back to that person through email. It doesn't
        actually work when you hit the submit button though.
        
        I put the "login" at the bottom for supposed admin users with an account to add more songs
        to the lists (perhaps through another page where you can submit songs and it'll add it, but
        I'm not actually implementing this).

    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>
        This site is for those who are looking for fresh new song recommendations! How it works is simple: all you
        have to do is complete and submit the form at the bottom of the page, and you'll receive an email with your
        personalized recommendations. However, if you're short on time, you can take a look from our Current
        Recommendations list, which has some songs you might like.
    </p>

    <p>
        As of right now, most recommendations will be from the following broad three genres: 80s Japan City Pop,
        K-rnb, and K-pop. We're looking forward to expanding this list in the future.
    </p>

    <p>

        selections? Please contact us through:
