    <h2>Welcome to Sarah's Favorite Lyric Center!</h2>

    <p>
        This website is just a collection of my favorite lyrics from the songs
        I listen to. On the left/top box, I'll put the lyric and on the right/bottom box
        is a reason why I like it so much.
    </p>

    <!-- one flexbox per lyric-description pair -->
    <div class="container">
        <!-- contains the lyric; left/top-->
        <div class="grid-item lyric">
            <p>"해가 뜨기 전 새벽이 가장 어두우니까."</p>
            <p>(Because the dawn right before the sunrise is the darkest.)</p>
            <p><b>- BTS (방탄소년단) in <i>Tomorrow</i></b></p>

                This is a rather hopeful lyric I admire a lot. The whole song in general
                is about looking forward to tomorrow positively and pushing forward to
                achieve your dreams. Before the most beautiful things, although not
                necessarily always, things can be the toughest because you're almost there.
                And this concept is displayed with nature.

        <div class="grid-item lyric">
            <p>"시간은 물 흐르듯이 흘러가고, 난 추억이란 댐을 놓아."</p>
            <p>(Time passes like water flows, I'm building a dam called memories.)</p>
            <p><b>- AKMU (악동뮤지션) in <i>Time and Fallen Leaves (시간과 낙엽)</i></b></p>

                The definition of a dam is a barrier constructed to hold back water,
                usually for water supply or to generate electricity. All time flows into this
                dam and holds all the memories, which we collect over time. They'll rest there
                for a long time, memories that we want to forget or remember, and they're only
                accumulating as time goes on and never waits.

            <p>"아름다운 건 늘 소중하고, 잠시 머물다 아득히 멀어져도."</p>
            <p>(What's beautiful is always precious,
                even if it stays for a moment and goes far away later.)</p>
            <p><b>- D.O. (디오) in <i>That's okay (괜찮아도 괜찮아)</i></b></p>

                I personally think about this lyric a lot because some moments, no matter
                how bittersweet they become, no matter how short they are, they're still
                beautiful and I'll still treasure them for as long as I remember them.
                I think everyone has these moments, bittersweet but beautiful.
